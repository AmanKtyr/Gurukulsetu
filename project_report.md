## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive School and College Management System named "Gurukul Setu" that streamlines administrative tasks, enhances communication between stakeholders, and provides efficient management of educational institutions. The system aims to digitize and automate various processes involved in managing educational institutions, reducing paperwork and manual effort while improving data accuracy and accessibility.

In the current educational landscape in India, there is a growing need for integrated management systems that can handle the complex operations of educational institutions. Traditional paper-based systems and disconnected software solutions are inefficient and prone to errors. Gurukul Setu addresses these challenges by providing a unified platform that covers all aspects of institutional management.

### 1.2 Scope
